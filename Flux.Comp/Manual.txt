Thank you for using Flux.Comp V0.1 !

This manual will describe how to use the script. In order to use Flux.Comp the user needs collumns named
"ID", The ID needed to differentiate between different oxygenprofiles in the dataset with profiles (For easy assignment of ID's see the script
      "Luna script assignID")
"C" , Concentration in units ... ben ik weer vergeten ^^"
"TC" , (Optional but preferable! )Temperature in degrees Celsius
"Por, Porosity
"Author" This is to work between different datasets of different authors, if this is not applicable fill in a dummy value
"x.cor" The corrected X coordinates in units micrometer, if you wish to do no such depth correction simply rename
        your depth parameter with x.cor. Values INSIDE the sediment are positive, whilst values inside the watercollumn are negative 
        If you do wish to correct for depth see my script "Luna Zerodepthcor script."


Optional values (needed for FLIPPER)

"P" Pressure in bars
"S" salinity (no units
"z"
"Dmol"
"Ds"

The parameters needed to make the script run are:

Data.frame.name, the dataframe name of the dataset to be considered.

IDs.to.analyse, a single ID number or vector of ID's to calculate fluxes for.

Filepathplot, The place where plots should be saved to, if taken as "FALSE" then no plot is saved. example: "./Dummymap"

Filepathresults, same thing but here the name of the results file should be specified in the pathing. example:"./Dummymap/Mydata"

PROFILE.files: Profile.exe generates files upon use, these are automatically removed to prevent clutter, if one wishes to keep these files per ID set to false

Species default to "O2"
