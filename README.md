# Public-scripts-Luna
The finished and less finished scripts for public use
Here you will find all the major scripts that I used for my master thesis "Statistical data analysis of
oxygen consumption in marine sediments".

Flux.Comp is a wrapper function which combines the PROFILE and FLIPPER package and analyzes porewater profiles 
using the 3 methods (Ficks law, PROFILE, and Savitzky-Golay).

Gen_O2_Profile generates novel oxygen profiles with known flux rates and consumption rates.

Flux.Comp can also work with the data generated from Gen_O2_Profile directly.
