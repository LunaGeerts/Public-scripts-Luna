Thank you for using Gen.O2.profile !

This manual will briefly explain how to use the script. There are 4 required inputs for the script in order to run.


"N" ,The amount of data points you want to model.
"L" , The depth of the sediment you want to model in meters 
for more info on these two parameters check the functions "tran.1D","setup.grid.1D" in the package reactran

"por", the porosity of your sediment otherwise known as the volume fraction of the sediment that consists of water, a value between 0 and 1

Then either 

Flux.top or O2.ow needs to be given in units mmol m^-2 day^-1 and mmol m^-3 respectively

Flux top is the flux at the water sediment interface, O2.ow is the oxygen concentration of the overlying water

The other arguments are optional

S,P and TC are all inputs to derive the diffusion coefficient , see package "marelac" for more info
Ks is the half saturation constant given in mmol m^-3
R.O2 is the consumption rate in mmol m^-3 day^-1


OUTPUT:

The output will consist of an 
ID=1 since flux.comp needs this to work.
x.cor or the "corrected depth" in micrometer
C concentration O2 in mmol m^-3
Por as in the porosity
T temperature in celsius
S salinity
P pressure in pascale
Author = "Luna.gen profile" indicating its an generated profile
True.Flux , either the inputted flux or the flux calculated from steady state when concentration of the overlying water is given
